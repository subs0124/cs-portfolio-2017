    <div id=CPUbox class=container> <p> The CPU is a component that controls the other computer components. By sending out signals, the CPU gives the other components instructions on what to perform, by turning data input into information output. The CPU determines the capability of the system. In recent years the top performance cpus were made by these two manufacturers, AMD and Intel. There are many more manufacturers that have a trusted name, but AMD and Intel's cpus tend to have higher customer satisfaction and reviews.  </p>
