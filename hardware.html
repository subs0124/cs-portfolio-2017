<h1>CPU (Central Processing Unit)-</h1>
<div id=CPUbox class=container>
    <p> The CPU is a component that controls the other computer components. By sending out signals, the CPU gives the other components instructions on what to perform, by turning data input into information output. The CPU determines the capability of the
        system. In recent years the top performance cpus were made by these two manufacturers, AMD and Intel. There are many more manufacturers that have a trusted name, but AMD and Intel's cpus tend to have higher customer satisfaction and reviews. Extra
        Info- it's speed is measured in MHz and GHz. </p>

<h1>RAM (Random Access Memory)- </h1>
<div id=R AMbox class=container>
    <P> RAM is temporary storage for data. It's accessed when data is currently being in use. The processor in the computer quickly accesses it every time you use your computer. When your computer is not in use, all of the RAM is lost (all of it's data is
        lost). When the RAM is full of data, your computer will start working slower due to the hard disk overlaying information to help the computer keep up. Due to your computer constantly using RAM, it was made to be easily directly accessed making
        it easier to retrieve recent data.
