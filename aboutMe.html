                <p>Hello there, some of you might know me and some of you might not. For those who don't know me or just forgot my name, I'm Sabrina Robinson a student of Summit Shasta. As of now I'm in the 10th grade. I haven't travelled much in my lifetime,
                    but I plan on doing so in the future. I like backpacking and hiking, so I do go on many mini adventures. Growing up in the city, I rarely saw trees or even forests because of this I love nature. Travelling, backpacking and hiking are
                    a new interest of mine and I hope to do more of it in the near future. I have many more interests that I'm statring to explore now that I am living the last of my childhood days such as horseback riding, costume making, gardening and
                    etc.

                <ul>
                    <li>Sweets. Desserts and candies are one of my favorite things to eat. My grandfather has a major sweet tooth and as a child he would always give me tons of candy.</li>
                    <li>Painting. I like watercolor painting. It really helps calm me down and is really fun.</li>
                    <li>Eating. I really enjoy food. My dad works in the food industry, so my sisters and I grew up spoiled with delectable foods.</li>
                    <li>HUGS. I really like receiving good hugs from close friends and family. My family has no boundaries, so I received tons of hugs and kisses while growing up.</li>
