    <h1>Who I am:</h1>
    <p>Hello there, some of you might know me and some of you might not. For those who don't know me or just forgot my name, I’m Sabrina Robinson a student of Summit Shasta. As of now I'm in the 10th grade. I haven’t travelled much in my lifetime, but I plan on doing so in the future. I like backpacking and hiking, so I do go on many mini adventures. 
    </p>

    <h1>My Favorite Somethings:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Sweets. Desserts and candies are one of my favorite things to eat. My grandfather has a major sweet tooth and as a child he would always give me tons of candy.</li>
        <li>Painting. I like water color painting. It relly helps calm me down and is really fun.</li>
        <li>Eating. I really enjoy food. My dad works in the food industry, so my sisters and I grew up spoiled with delectable foods.</li>
    </ul>
